            APPROACH:
            1. Analyze the weather (temperature, conditions, humidity, wind) and user context (formality, occasion)
            2. For each clothing category needed, construct an intelligent search query that captures:
            - Temperature appropriateness (hot/warm/cool/cold descriptors)
            - Weather conditions (rain-resistant, breathable, wind-proof, etc.)
            - Formality level (casual, business, formal, etc.)
            - Material preferences (cotton, wool, linen, etc.)
            - Style attributes (comfortable, professional, elegant, etc.)

            USE THE SMART_CATEGORY_SEARCH TOOL for each category:
            - Use format: "your_intelligent_query|category"
            - Categories: top, bottom, footwear, outerwear, accessory
            - Construct queries that combine weather needs + context + style

            EXAMPLE QUERIES:
            - Hot formal dinner: "lightweight breathable formal elegant dress shirt|top"
            - Cold casual day: "warm cozy comfortable casual sweater|top"  
            - Rainy business meeting: "professional water-resistant business shoes|footwear"
