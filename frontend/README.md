## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Make sure the FastAPI backend is running:
```bash
# From the project root
uv run uvicorn weather_outfit_ai.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Option 1: Direct Python Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install streamlit requests

# Run the frontend
python run_frontend.py
```

### Option 2: Using UV (Recommended)

```bash
# From project root
uv sync
uv run python frontend/run_frontend.py
```

### Option 3: Direct Streamlit

```bash
cd frontend
streamlit run app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
```

The frontend will be available at: http://localhost:8501

## Docker Usage

### Build the frontend container

```bash
cd frontend
docker build -t weather-outfit-ai-frontend .
```

### Run the frontend container

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 weather-outfit-ai-frontend
```

### Using Docker Compose (Full Stack)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` in the project root:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      - WEATHER_API_KEY=${WEATHER_API_KEY}
    env_file:
      - .env

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "8501:8501"
    depends_on:
      - backend
    environment:
      - API_URL=http://backend:8000
```

Then run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Configuration

The frontend automatically detects the API URL. You can configure it in the sidebar:

- **Default**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **Docker**: `http://backend:8000` (when using docker-compose)
- **Custom**: Any URL where your FastAPI backend is running

## Usage

1. **Enter Location**: Type the city or location (e.g., "New York", "London")
2. **Select Style**: Choose your preferred style (casual, business, formal, etc.)
3. **Choose Time**: Select when you need the outfit (now, today, tomorrow, etc.)
4. **Get Recommendation**: Click the button to get your personalized outfit

### Chat Mode
1. **Switch to Chat**: Select "üí¨ Chat Mode" from the dropdown

   - "Tell me about the weather in Tokyo"
3. **Interactive Dialog**: Continue the conversation with follow-up questions

- Or use UV: `uv sync`

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill processes on port 8501
lsof -t -i tcp:8501 | xargs kill -9

# Or use a different port
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Modify `frontend/app.py`
2. Test locally with `streamlit run app.py`
3. Update Docker image if needed

### API Integration
The frontend uses the following API endpoints:
